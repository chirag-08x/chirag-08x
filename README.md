# 💫 About Me:
👋🏽 Hi, I'm Chirag Agrawal

🎓 A 2023 Computer Science graduate with a knack for turning complex problems into streamlined solutions that drive business success.

🌍 Hailing from the vibrant landscapes of India, I'm fueled by a passion for innovation and excellence in software development.

💼 Over the past 2 years, I've honed my skills as a Frontend Developer, contributing to impactful projects across diverse industries. My journey has taken me through exciting roles at Gamitar (Full-time), Azodha (Intern), Micro (Intern), and Kyte (Freelance).

🚀 My ambition is to evolve into a Software Engineer, where I can collaborate with a dynamic team and continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in technology.

🌱 When I'm not coding, you'll find me diving into the pool, strategizing over a game of snooker, or hitting the cricket pitch.

💡 I'm always eager to discuss Software Engineering, cutting-edge Development practices, and the art of Problem Solving (DSA).
